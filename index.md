# Accomplishments 2015-16 -- Ryan Culligan
1. cgap
  * Consensus gene annotation program
    * Capable of assembling 60,000 genes in 24 hours (1,500 genes, 40 individuals)
    * Builds phylip consensus
2. SNP pipeline
  * BWA / GATK mapping pipeline that identifies genomic variants from multiple individuals to assist in array design
3. PSMC pipeline
  * Created demographic histories for Prolemur simus, Microcebus murinus, and  Propithecus coquereli
4. Kian8.4 genomic assembly
  * Contig n50: 20,000 -> 49,000
  * Scaffold n50: 200,000 -> 1,900,000 (1.9MB)
  * Performed quality assessment and assembly comparisons:
    * BUSCO -- Single copy ortholog analysis
    * QUAST -- N50 / N90 analysis
    * vcftools -- sliding window analysis
5. UNO Web Application

  * Application and setting modifications
6. arcGIS Mapping
  * Aye Aye -- Nico
    * aKDE / MCP
  * Prolemur simus -- Cynthia
    * aKDE / MCP
  * Reforestation
7. Microsatellite Applications for Galapagos Tortoises
8. Computers
  * Genetics Storage Server

  * Organized parts for new supercomputer
9. Installed Solar Panels at KAFS and MDF
10. Autosome / Allosome Extraction Pipeline
  * Extracts autosome / allosome from non-chromosome tied genomic assemblies
11. Database Software -- (merge / clean / store)
  * Prolemur simus
  * Reforestation
12. Prolemur simus bates capture array design
  * Extracted 5,000+ uce for 5 individuals
  * Identified shared genomic SNPs between Simus individuals
  * Extracted genomic sequences for bates
13. Data Storage / Consistency
  * Created storage guidelines for large datasets
    * Organize
    * Compress
    * md5sum -- ensures data stays valid over time allows for consistency checking
  * Kept records and documentation for all programs written and experiments run
    * [Kian8.4 Genome Example](https://github.com/TheCulliganMan/kian_8.4)
